# Palindrome Detector

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Examples in English include `A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!`, `Amor, Roma`, `race car`, `stack cats`, `step on no pets`, `taco cat`, `put it up`, `Was it a car or a cat I saw?` and `No ‘x’ in Nixon`.

Write the most efficient function you can that determines whether a given string is a palindrome.

Your function should accept a string as a parameter and return a boolean (true if the string is a palindrome, false if it is not).

Assume that this code will be put into a real production system and write accordingly.
